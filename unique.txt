Title: Help Indiana Jones!
About: Indiana Jones has just finished another one of his adventures. Help him escape this crumbling cave! 

Rules:
- Use the left and right arrow to dodge the rocks that fall from the top
- Dodge as many of the rocks as you can and try to survive as long as you can 

Unique features: 
- Rocks start at random positions on top and outside of the window screen 
- Rocks fall at a slow pace at the beginning, and at a greater quantity 
- As time progresses, the number of rocks decrease and the falling speed increases 
- Our character Indiana Jones moves at a tender speed - to increase the difficulty of the game as time goes on 
- Indiana also moves smoothly without having to press keys over and over again
- Indiana can't go off-screen! 
- And, if our character Indiana Jones collides/overlaps with one of the rocks, game is over... 
- A cave background for better aesthetics
